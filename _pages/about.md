I am an autumn doctoral student majoring in Computer Science and Technology from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in China. I am honored to become and receive an offer from [Professor Ma](https://faculty.nuaa.edu.cn/mazongmin/zh_CN/index.htm). My research mainly focuses on Event graph and Complex Reasoning. This involves exploring the integration of various concepts and technologies, including event, graph neural network, knowledge graph, and temporal knowledge graph. Event graph is an event-centered knowledge graph, which includes knowledge graph, temporal knowledge graph and spatio-temporal knowledge graph. It is the master of knowledge graph. If you are interested in collaborating or just chatting, please feel free to contact me via email or add me on WeChat. We look forward to our dialogue and mutual learning, creating new opportunities for cooperation, just like where there is a will, there is a way and achieve extraordinary things for you and me.
